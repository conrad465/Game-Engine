As a project team, we:

c) Promise to do our work on time or communicate proactively with the team if there will be a delay.  
d) Promise to help our fellow team members when they need it.  
e) Promise to communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.

  * Facebook Messenger; each subgroup can choose their own method of communication
* Decision-making policy (by consensus? by majority vote?): 
  * Majority vote via messenger polling

    * A member from each subgroup will set their agendas (roles will be assigned once groups are formed)
    * A shared google doc will be used to notify other teammates about the agenda
    * We will checkout every bullet point we discussed so we keep the meeting on track. (Stefani Vukajlovic)
